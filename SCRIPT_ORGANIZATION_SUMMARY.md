# Script Organization Summary

## Overview
All utility and maintenance scripts have been organized into a properly structured `scripts/` directory with subdirectories for different types of scripts.

## Directory Structure

```
scripts/
├── README.md              # Documentation for all scripts
├── database/             # Database-related scripts
│   └── migrate.py       # Database migration tool
├── deployment/          # Deployment and CI/CD scripts
│   └── deploy.sh        # Production deployment script
├── development/         # Development utilities
│   └── run_tests.py     # Test runner script
├── docker/              # Docker-related scripts
│   ├── docker-build.sh  # Docker image build script
│   ├── entrypoint.sh    # Docker container entrypoint
│   └── wait-for-it.sh   # Wait for services to be ready
└── maintenance/         # System maintenance scripts
    ├── backup.sh        # Database backup script
    ├── restore.sh       # Database restore script
    ├── update_config.sh # Configuration update helper
    └── verify_security.py # Security verification script
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Script Organization
- All scripts properly organized into subdirectories based on their function
- Removed duplicate `migrate.py` from root directory
- Scripts remain in their functional locations (e.g., Docker scripts also exist in docker/ for Docker context)

### 2. Path Updates
Updated script paths to work from their new locations:
- `scripts/database/migrate.py` - Updated Python path to find src modules
- `scripts/deployment/deploy.sh` - Updated PROJECT_ROOT path
- `scripts/maintenance/update_config.sh` - Updated PROJECT_ROOT path
- `scripts/maintenance/verify_security.py` - Updated Python path
- `scripts/docker/docker-build.sh` - Updated to work from project root

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Created comprehensive `scripts/README.md` with usage instructions
- Updated references in `PROJECT_REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md`
- Updated migration documentation in `docs/technical/MIGRATIONS.md`

### 4. Configuration Files
Configuration files remain in their appropriate locations:
- `alembic.ini` - In `config/`
- `pytest.ini` - In `config/`
- `Dockerfile` - In `config/docker/`
- Docker compose files - In root and `config/docker/`

## Usage Examples

### Database Migration
```bash
python scripts/database/migrate.py up
```

### Run Tests
```bash
python scripts/development/run_tests.py
```

### Deploy to Production
```bash
./scripts/deployment/deploy.sh
```

### Verify Security
```bash
python scripts/maintenance/verify_security.py
```

### Build Docker Image
```bash
./scripts/docker/docker-build.sh
```

## Notes
- All shell scripts should be executable: `chmod +x script.sh`
- Scripts expect to be run from the project root directory
- Python scripts automatically adjust their paths to find project modules
- Database scripts require proper credentials in `.env` file
